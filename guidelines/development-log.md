# Development Log

## Web App Overview

This application is a portfolio website for a filmmaker, Dustin Foret, built with Next.js and featuring the following key aspects:

1. **Architecture:**
   - Next.js frontend with App Router
   - MongoDB database for storing video metadata
   - Cloudflare Stream for video hosting and playback
   - Authentication provided by Clerk

2. **Core Features:**
   - Home page with a featured hero video and grid of portfolio work
   - Portfolio page (/my-work) showing all videos in a list format
   - Individual video pages (/my-work/[videoId]) for viewing specific projects
   - Admin area for managing video content (protected by authentication)
   - Contact functionality for potential clients to reach out

3. **Data Model:**
   - Videos are stored in MongoDB with the following structure:
     - title: The name of the video project
     - fullVideoId: ID for the full-length video on Cloudflare
     - bannerVideoId: ID for the banner/preview version of the video
     - description: Optional text about the project
     - order: Sequence number for controlling display order

4. **Video Integration:**
   - Videos are hosted on Cloudflare Stream
   - Custom video player components that embed Cloudflare Stream iframes
   - Different player configurations for hero videos vs. portfolio items

5. **Authentication & Security:**
   - Clerk authentication protecting admin routes
   - Public access to portfolio viewing pages
   - API routes for fetching video data

The application provides a clean, modern interface for showcasing Dustin's work, with responsive design via Tailwind CSS and dynamic content loading from the backend database.

#question: let's replace the "My Work" nav item with "About", and create an "About" page (`/about`). the page should have a headshot (i'll provide that later) and a bio: `Dustin Foret (b. 1995, Alameda, CA) is a director and editor living and working in Brooklyn, NY. Working across narrative, documentary, and commercial projects, Dustin focuses his stories on aspirations and failures, characters drowning in the maelstrom of chaos that is a byproduct of an unexplained and unpredictable world with a dash of bleak humor. His work won him the NIMS Scholarship from the UNO NIMS Foundation.

He is finding his way after returning to form from a hiatus taken because of a death in the family during the SAG/WGA strikes of 2023. Much like the characters in his stories, he trenches through the maelstrom in pursuit of art.

He's currently crafting a feature drama, To Be Declared Undead, where the lines between the living and the dead blur in unexpected ways.`

#answer: Completed this change by:
1. Updated the navigation menus in both main-nav.tsx and mobile-nav.tsx to replace "My Work" with "About" and point to the new "/about" route
2. Created a new About page at app/about/page.tsx with:
   - A placeholder for the headshot image (to be added later)
   - The full bio text formatted with proper spacing and styling
   - A responsive layout that will display the headshot to the left of the bio on larger screens

#follow-up: After creating the About page, the navigation bar wasn't showing on the About page. Why?

#answer: The navigation visibility was conditional based on the current path in the NavWrapper component. The condition was checking for paths that were either the home page ('/') or started with '/my-work'. Since we changed the route to '/about', I updated the condition in components/nav-wrapper.tsx to show the navigation when the path starts with '/about' instead of '/my-work'. This fixed the issue and now the navigation bar properly appears on the About page.

#question: The homepage portfolio grid shows "404 not found" errors for some videos. How can we fix this?

#answer: This issue was caused by videos in the database that had missing or invalid Cloudflare Stream IDs. I modified the homepage (app/page.tsx) to filter out any videos that don't have valid bannerVideoId values before displaying them in the grid. The validation checks if:
1. The bannerVideoId exists (not null or undefined)
2. It's a string type
3. It's not an empty string after trimming whitespace

This filtering prevents the 404 errors by ensuring only videos with properly formatted IDs are displayed on the page, improving the user experience.
